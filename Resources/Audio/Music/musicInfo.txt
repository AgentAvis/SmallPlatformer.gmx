This is going to act as a repo for samples of songs I've been mulling over/thinking about using for in-game music.
None of this is final, of course. I just like getting input on some of these, which ones fit/don't fit, where you would hear them playing
in-game. General stuff like that.

Most of the samples are unmixed and very subject to change, as usual.
